<p>Dear members of the committee, </p>
<p>It is a great honor that I submit my application to the faculty at Bern University. I am writing to
apply for a Ph.D. position within the project "Explaining Human Nature: Empirical and Ideological
Dimensions" after I am completing my master's course in the department of philosophy at
Sungkyunkwan University in 2018. I've got a master's degree with a thesis, "Nietzsche vs Heidegger",
which concerns the problem of nihilism, under the direction of Professor Jongkwan Lee. The
circumstance of the faculty at Bern University gives me a firm trust in my ambition of accomplishing
my academic career with the issues of my interest, individuality.</p>
<p>The aim of my master's thesis was to examine Nietzsche's attempt to overcome nihilism and
metaphysical and anthropological concepts by comparing with Heidegger's attempt. Developing it, I
realized that ex nihilo nihil fit: if we bleach all meanings from ourselves, then we could not create any
meaning from it. This realization leads me to currently change my focus from a self to an individual,
e.i. a person in a society.</p>
<p>I understand the gist of individuality as 'promising', i.e. autonomy and responsibility on one’s will.
That’s why I have focused on for a while a philosophical concept of ‘sovereign individual’ which
Nietzsche suggests in On the Genealogy of Morality. The sovereign individual is a type of human who
has a right to promise. I believe that it could be a key concept to approach various philosophical
issues; the relation between individuals and society; one’s existence on the temporal horizon; creating
values ex nihilo; or the way how the social exists and etc.</p>
<p>One more thing I want to say is that the concept of the sovereign individual is not merely
philosophical. This insight concerns the way a certain concept is taken as important. Specifically,
what it matters is not whether a certain concept can be empirically proven, but how it works on us
when it is accepted. With regard to this, the problem of sovereign individuals can be extended to
recent ethical and political issues like identity politics, birth rate problems, immigration, and etc. I
take the fundamental cause of these derived problems as the uncertainty of one's meaning of life. If we
can provide any proper answer for individuality, then it will be easier to seek the answers to the
derived problems.</p>
<p>Lastly, what I'm trying to do in this project is to deal with Nietzsche’s concept, sovereign
individual, even though my ultimate focus is on individuality in terms of the relation between society
and individuals as a social philosophical issue. My approach to SI in this project deeply concerns the
theoretical philosophy. Moreover, in order to deal with sovereign individual, there are several
preliminary concepts that I should examine, like Kantian free will and autonomy, etc. Those concepts also belong to this area. For this reason, I’ll devote myself to the disciplines for the theoretical as well
as the social philosophy.</p>
<p>I hope that you will carefully review my application for admission and give me a great opportunity
to keep going on my academic career. I am eager to share my ideas with other philosophers and to
develop it completely as much as I can. I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, <br>
Heehyun Jung</p>
