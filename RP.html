1. A debate on SI</p><p>
Sovereign individual(SI) is a person with the prerogative to promise. In the second essay of
On Genealogy of the Morality(GMII), Nietzsche describes SI's feature as follows: “an autonomous,
[...] this master of the freewill [...] has his own standard of value”(GMII:2). A debate on SI comes
from autonomy and free will. People who regard SI as overhuman tend to identify the autonomy with
the ability to create values; having his own standard of value. Thus, Nietzsche should support free
will. However, he rejected the concept of free will and autonomy by repeatedly attacking Kant.
When it comes to the incompatibility between two positions, Ken Gemes tries to explain it by
distinguishing deserts free will from agency free will. The former is a free will which Nietzsche
<a href="#fn[1]" name="go[1]">[1]</a>
denies while he regards the latter as positive. With this distinction, we can interpret that SI is taken as
positive to Nietzsche. On the other hand, there are other philosophers who don't accept Gemes’
attempt. Hatab maintains that SI doesn’t express overhuman, but the modern ideal of individual
rational autonomy. The main reason offered by him is that Nietzsche denies SI's features, autonomy
<a href="#fn[2]" name="go[2]">[2]</a>
and free will.</p>
<p>2. My approach for the problem of incompatibility</p>
<p>It seems to me that each of two positions grasps SI depending on its features. I maintain that
SI should be understood, not as the features, but as the requirements. When SI is a person with the
prerogative to promise, promises can be kept only when one never forgets her will to realize
something at a present point while it is actually realized at a future point. Thus, promising
presupposes 'willing', 'predictability' and 'memorizing'.</p><p>
In GMII, Nietzsche describes a scenario in which people meet the requirements. People have
instincts. What they behave according to instincts is 'to create forms' and 'to imprint forms'. I
understand 'to create forms' as willing and 'to imprint forms' as realizing it. However, instincts are
only exercised by a superior minority, the rulers, not by the ruled. Rather, the ruled should suppress
their own instinct. Their suppressed instinct doesn’t disappear, but the ruled invoke it towards
themselves. The suppressed instinct which can be discharged only against themselves consists of a
bad conscience. A bad conscience makes their soul from inner side. These souls are the places where
the ruler’s forms are imprinted. The rulers command the ruled to follow their forms by means of
violence. In this manner, the forms are imprinted in their soul accompanied with pain and the ruled
come to memorize the forms. The requirements for having an ability to memorize are to feel pain and
to have a soul. Eventually, people come to be predictable beings.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a person who meets all the requirements for promising such as ‘willing’,
‘predictability,’, and ‘memorizability'. However, there is a lack of something, since the rulers don’t
have any soul to memorize besides only power to will, while the ruled have only souls without any

power to will. There is no one able to will and memorize at the same time. Nietzsche suggested a
concept of active forgetfulness; it is to forget what is imprinted in a soul for a little tabula-rasa of
consciousness to make room for the nobler functions such as ruling, predicting, predetermining.
These nobler functions can be interpreted as willing, predicting and promising. SI, the ruled who
forget, dare to give pain to themselves in order to memorize their will.</p><p>
Those requirements are necessary conditions for SI while the features aren't. Likewise,
autonomy and free will are also in the same case. It is definitely possible that those occur in other
types of people than SI.</p><p>
Against my approach, philosophers who deny SI possibly object that there is only one type of
person in GMII, so analyzing the features by introducing other types of people is an
overinterpretation. However, there are actually other types of people presented in GMII. According to
GMII:1, promising is an active desire and it is compared with a passive inability. The symptoms of
this inability can be believed apparently as a memory, promising. The victim of the technique of
mnemonics in GMII:3 is the avatar of this inability. She is forced to memorize negative will,
'I-don't-want-to', through pain. This memory and being promised are passive. Thus, being promised
should be distinguished from memorizing and promising. Consequently, active free will is distinct
from passive free will, then the problem is solved.
