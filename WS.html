<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The aim of this research is to find an answer to the problem of meaninglessness in one’s life, that
is, the problem of nihilism, by discussing the relation between individuals and society in terms of the
notion of ‘promise.’ In Chapter 1, we will discuss how the meaning of the existence for each
individual is coming up with making a promise, focusing on Heidegger's term, ‘dasein’. Those will
reveal the structure of promising. This structure shifts the burden of creating the meaning of existence
for each individual over to each individual. However, this kind of burden cannot be resolved at the
individual level. In this context, Chapter 2 will deal with the relation between individuals and society
in terms of promise. Thomas Hobbes maintained that society is built by the contract of each subject in
spite of their relinquishing their own right. This sort of contract is hardly expected to be fulfilled by
their own will because the contract makes themselves unable to live freely. In order for a sovereign to
make individuals keep their promise, a sovereign should exercise her power so as to make them have
fear. However, such sovereignty is created from the contracts. At this point, we can see that contracts
and sovereignty come to be circular. Therefore, for the subjects, there is no reason to fulfill contracts
were it not for fear from their sovereign. And the apparent promise is nothing but coercion, as a matter
of fact, which will lead to them into a confrontation. Michel Foucault was trying to grasp several
historical social strategies to overcome difficulties for its maintenance. With his insightful
examination, I believe that we could see how a society begins to ‘invent’ a type of individual who is
able to make a promise. Chapter 3 points out that the notion of promise also has a deficiency in terms
that it cannot give each individual a guarantee that life is worth living. Nevertheless, it seems to me
that there is a potential way out to get over that deficiency. It might be politics along with individual
will to meaning.</p>

<h4>
<a href="#i1" name="p1">1. An individual and promise</a></h4><p>
It is generally said that the lives of all human beings are full of pain. Nietzsche commented on this
as follows: “What really raises one's indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but the
senselessness[meaninglessness] of suffering.”<a href="#fn[1]" name="go[1]">[1]</a> If one’s life is worth living, put differently, if there is a
meaning of one’s life, human beings could endure their own lives well depending on the value of their
lives. Otherwise, they couldn't stand up to their lives. This sort of meaninglessness possibly forces
each human being to choose one of the extremely existential options, e.i. depression, akrasia, suicide,
etc. In this sense, it is not the pain itself but its meaninglessness that each of us as human beings
should overcome in our lives. One peculiar thing we should remember when we try to handle this
situation is that it is not just a personal problem to be solved by each individual. In other words, the
problem of meaninglessness may be treated and solved at the level of society. If all this story is
correct, the next step we have to go on is just to examine what it means that each member of a
community exists as an individual who primarily doubts over her meaning of life.</p>
<h5><a href="#i1.1" name="p1.1">1.1. An individual and its individuality</a></h5><p>
In order to inquire about the relation between individuals and society, it is required to examine
what kind of components consist of that relation. In terms of the problem of nihilism, the question
concerning an individual should be in advance of the question concerning society. It's because facing
the meaninglessness and its overcoming are supposed to be a kind of event experienced by
individuals. It is not clear that a society is a kind of substance which can experience a meaningless
state like any individual. And even though it could experience it, it is also hard to say that
nihilism-related events could carry the same importance to society as to individuals. What is definitely
clear is that a society is not a living being or a living body.</p><p>
All individuals who consist of a society are distinct and distinguishable from each other. They
have their own individuality as long as each individual is taken as one and the same being among the
numbers of individuals. Otherwise, no matter how detailed criteria of social roles may be suggested, it
would always fail to identify two distinct people who have the same roles in their society as two
individuals with entirely different lives. For, although classifying people along with their social roles
could be an easier way to differentiate them within some boundaries to a certain extent, if there is no
feature which makes someone as one and the same person, some people who perform the same atomic
social role in a society cannot be differentiated by this way. However, it is hard to deny that an
individual refers to a person as a distinct and differentiated substance. For this reason, there should be
some peculiar individuality which each individual possesses, making each individual distinct.</p>

<h5><a href="#i1.2" name="p1.2">1.2. Meaning of existence and boredom</a></h5>
<p>
First of all, let me illustrate what I understood as Heidegger's nihilism as follows. According to
Heidegger, human beings are Dasein.<a href="#fn[2]" name="go[2]">[2]</a> Being Dasein means being asking for their own meaning of
existence, saying that again, being in doubt about their individuality. Such doubt leads human beings
to head their own individuality. However, when human beings fall into boredom, they forget to ask
who they are. Boredom is a mood which engages someone when she is being in a stretched present.<a href="#fn[3]" name="go[3]">[3]</a> A
stretched present can be understood in comparison with the non-stretched present. When human
beings are authentically being, they are temporally being; they are being on their temporal horizon.<a href="#fn[4]" name="go[4]">
[4]</a>
Their temporal horizon includes all aspects of their time; their past which makes them themselves;
their future which is conceived by themselves; and the present in which they move forward to their
future as themselves. In short, when human beings are temporally being, they are in their present
which is linked with their history; their past and future. What makes a human being ask her own
meaning of existence is her temporal horizon which could become her own history. Thus, as far as a
human being is temporally being, her existence comes to have her own meaning. On the contrary, the
stretched present isn’t included within a temporal horizon, which means that it is not linked with any
past or future at all. It is experienced only as an isolated present. Therefore, each of human beings
who are located in the stretched present fails to find a source of meaning of her existence. Thus, in
boredom, she finds out that she doesn’t know who she is or what it means that she is alive. It is what I
understood as Heidegger’s nihilism.</p>
<p>However, Heidegger regards boredom as an opportunity for someone to recover her authenticity.
According to him, human beings in daily life are not distinct and distinguishable from each other
because they are mixed in a society thus human beings in a mixed society share the temporal horizon
which is just void and common. For this reason, when there are human beings who are mixed in a
society, there is only one temporal horizon, which means that there is only one identity. To put it
another way, although there are many human beings, there is just an undiscriminated mass of them. In
terms of Heidegger, an undiscriminated mass is das man<a href="#fn[5]" name="go[5]">[5]</a>. Being as das man means not being authentic, but being only anonymous. For a das man, boredom itself , being disconnected from every
meaning which someone has, is an opportunity to reconstruct her own meaning of existence and
recover her authenticity from anonymity. But being in boredom actually means being disconnected
from every kind of meaning. In this mood, she cannot acquire any meaning from others. Given ex
nihilo nihil fit, there is no basis for reconstructing herself from such meaninglessness. Thus, he must
stand against the given words, he eventually suggests his notorious concept; Nothing as the
concealment of being<a href="#fn[6]" name="go[6]">[6]</a>; the nothing which produces something. This paradoxical concept makes him

cannot avoid saying: <br>

"[...] This philosophizing entry and return of man into the Dasein in him can only ever
be prepared, never effected. Awakening is a matter for each individual human being, not
a matter of his or her good will or even skillfulness, but of his or her destiny, whatever
falls or does not fall to him or her. [..]"<a href="#fn[7]" name="go[7]">[7]</a>
<br>

What Heidegger finally achieved is with adding the paradox is to complete his system of Dasein.
However, at the same time, this complete system ascends into the world beyond human beings. He
cannot explain how something is produced from nothing, but he just claims that it is possible. Since
human beings cannot handle such a paradox, now they cannot accomplish to recover their authenticity
from being boredom. As he says, it is out of their hands; philosophizing, skillfulness, good will. Such
endeavors are just human, all too human. Of course, he says it depends on her destiny but, as far as I
understood, this kind of destiny just means giving up.</p>

<h5><a href="#i1.3" name="p1.3">1.3. Heidegger's nihilism and negation</a></h5>
<p>It seems to me that it does not help to solve the problem to suggest such a destiny. However,
Heidegger cannot help but suggest it for, as stated above, there is no more way out for him insofar as
he defines nihilism as the mood; boredom. He removed the whole meaning surrounding an individual
through it. In this regard, the individual couldn't produce anything, for no material for production can
be found. Therefore, a different explanation of nihilism should be suggested.
In this context, nihilism should not be assumed as the removal of the whole meaning surrounding
an individual, but it should be assumed merely as the denial of the meanings of her existence and the
world around her. Although the whole meaning is negated it doesn’t mean that there remains nothing:
there still remains something which is negated. If so, an individual in nihilism is still surrounded by
something meaningful which is negated.</p>
<p>Then, how and why does an individual come to negate something meaningful around herself? In
response to this, let me go back to the structure of the temporal being. Who an individual is depends
on what kind of past she has been through. And her future which she conceives of is determined by
what she planned as herself who is determined from her past. In other words, her future is determined
by her active behavior; conceiving. Consequently, what she tries to conceive of is what she pursues as
meaning of her existence for her future, so what she conceives of is unlikely to be what would deny
her meaning which is determined from her past. It means that she would selectively conceive of
something as her future. What she conceives of as her future should be affirmed in her shoes.
Her past can be analyzed in the same way as her future is analyzed, but there is something
different. She cannot be active but only passive to her past, unlike her future. Her past is what
happened to her, so what she cannot help but passively undergo. In this case, for her, there is no room
to avoid or to dismiss. Thus, her past could not be constituted only with what she would affirm. In her
past, there must be something mixed which she wants to negate or regards as meaningless. Although
her past is composed of both what she could affirm and what she couldn’t do, it is rightly her past and
it determines who she is. Therefore, she cannot completely affirm who she is. However, even when
she falls into such self-hatred, she is still a person who is determined by the past. The problem is that
she cannot affirm the person as herself; at this point, the links of her past and her future with her
presence come to be negated by her. Of course, she is still surrounded with something meaningful.
However, she cannot affirm such a meaning as her own meaning. In other words, she is a person who
she isn’t. Now, she is being as das man who is nobody.</p>
<h5><a href="#i1.4" name="p1.4">1.4. An Individual and promise</a></h5>
<p>How could nobody become somebody? While das man is nobody, it is regarded as somebody to
the extent that it is placed in a temporal horizon. It means that there is an image of the future that is
directed by das man. In the meanwhile, its future cannot be conceived by itselves, nor has it been
affirmed to as its own since it is nobody. Thus, this future isn’t an identity and cannot make das man
an individual, and is nothing more than a rule given from the others. However, speaking in the
opposite direction, what das man requires to be an individual is just to have an identity. it is being on a
temporal horizon which is linked with one’s past and future which is affirmed to have an identity.
Aforementioned, das man is already being on a temporal horizon, it<a href="#fn[8]" name="go[8]">[8]</a> also has its past and meanings
which are denied by it. Thus, what das man should do to be an individual is just to accept any rule and
to affirm it as its own meaning. Even a das man's life is filled with negations, it doesn’t mean that it
cannot have its own attitude. For negating can be affirming the negation of something, so negating is a
sort of attitude. In this sense people who are in the position of a nihilistic view could still affirm
something and set it out as a meaning of them. It is promising that each individual regards her own
attitude toward the future as her own meaning and then invokes a will to make it happen.</p>
<p>Promising has three different meanings in terms of the structure of temporal being. First, for
someone, it is to affirm her past which determines who she is. Thus, to promise entails to affirm that
she is an individual with her history. Secondly, for someone, to promise is to affirm her future of
which is conceived by the individual which her past determines because the future linked with the
present is settled by the individual who the past determines. Once the past has been affirmed, she is so
determined to affirm what she conceives as the individual and to express who she is through the
future. Finally, for someone, to promise is to affirm her existence as an individual. Promising can be
completed through a voluntary affirmation of her existence. As promising concerns about who she is,
it is about her history, about her whole life, and about her will to promise which is identical to her will
to life. Through this kind of affirming, das man becomes the individual. Human beings exist as
individuals by the promising.</p>
<p>By the way, what the negated meanings which das man affirms to be an individual concretely are?
If we cannot say what it is, promising isn’t different from Heidegger’s destiny with regard to
possibility of actualization. Of course, it is past which is experienced by each das man, which
determines each das man, and lastly, which das man denied. However, such a description is a result
from dealing das man only in terms of individual dimension. As aforementioned, das man is a mass of
human beings which is mixed in a society. Thus, this mass should be treated as something social. That
is to say, das man as a human being who denies what it experiences is already in a society, insofar as
what it experiences should be understood as events in society and meaning which is given from
society. In short, what das man denies and affirms to be an individual are social being.
<p>However, if an individual is born in society and exists as herself by affirming a given social being
as her own meaning, then straightforwardly, society is a foundation for human beings to exist as
individuals. However, in what sense does society exist in that way? And what does it mean for society
to invoke its members as individuals, as human beings who identify themselves with promising?</p>
<h4><a href="#i2" name="p2">2. Society and promise</a></h4>
<p>Human beings, as components of society, have an ontological priority to society. Human beings
without their society may exist in a state like being wild animals but any society without its members
may not exist. It's obvious that a society is something actualized by human beings while a society
must somehow control its members in order to sustain itself. Foucault says:<br>
“In short this power is exercised rather than possessed; it is not the ‘privilege’, acquired or
preserved, of the dominant class, but the overall effect of its strategic positions - an effect that is
manifested and sometimes extended by the position of those who are dominated.”
<a href="#fn[9]" name="go[9]">[9]</a><br>
If power is the whole effect from a strategic position of the dominant class[sovereign], then every
role of society can be analyzed as a strategic position of it which aims some social effects from the
perspective of the power, as what Foucault describes. As we know, all individuals are brought up by
their society. If this role of upbringing individuals is a strategic position, what effect does it aim?
Paraphrased, if individuality contributes to society, and only in such a way society does have an
interest to nurture human beings as individuals.</p>
<h5><a href="#i2.1" name="p2.1">2.1. Society and promise for sovereignty</a></h5>
<p>According to Hobbes, human beings in their naturall[natural] condition[state] have liberty to use
his own power, as he will himselfe[himself] and are made so equall[equal], in the faculties of body,
and mind because “Impediments, may oft take away part of a mans[man's] power to do what hee[he]
would; but cannot hinder him from using the power left him, according as his judgement, and reason
shall dictate to him”<a href="#fn[10]" name="go[10]">[10]</a> and “For as to the strength of body, the weakest has strength enough to kill the

strongest, either by secret machination, or by confederacy with others, that are in the same danger.”<a href="#fn[11]" name="go[11]">
[11]</a></p>
<p>Ironically, human beings are thrown into a state of misery due to their equality and liberty. Human
beings with an equal power become rivals to each other for they have similar goals. They can do
anything about their competitors whatever they want because they have liberty and so can their
competitors do.<a href="#fn[12]" name="go[12]">[12]</a> In this state, human beings must prepare for all kinds of aggression. If they would
loosen their guard just with their wishful thinking that their opponent won't hurt them, it is rarely
possible for them to defend themselves when their wish happens to be betrayed. For this reason, it is
quite natural that human beings surrounded by each other come to regard their neighbors as potential
risky elements. It means that they are exposed to be under the dangerous condition that their own
outcomes can be deprived by others. When there is no guarantee that outcomes could be possessed by
their own, there is no reason for them to make any effort of productive behavior. They are not able to
pursue their own future in a condition of warre[state of war].</p>
<p>In order to overcome this misery, human beings have to have any guarantees that their opponents
will not hurt them. Of course, they could mutually declare that they won't hurt each other, while a
trust for it is a completely different matter. A promise is different from a declaration. As an affirming
one’s future, promising entails not only a declaration of the future but also a possession of will to
actualize it. On the one hand, a human being regards her declaration as a promise on account of
coming to believe in her own will. On the other hand, she cannot trust each other's will and she cannot
believe that the declaration from others will be actualized in reality. It is foolish to lay down your
shield at the very moment when your opponent is drawing his bow. This is a simple but primitive
attitude. Although she breaks the declaration, there is nothing to lose for her. Rather, she may take
advantage of this to eliminate one of competitors. For this reason, it is highly probable for a human
being who fulfill the declaration to fall into the worst scenario by being in a defenseless and
dangerous state. That's why they couldn't actualize their declaration, even if they were trying to do so.
There cannot be any guarantee which makes people promising each other.</p>
<p>In order to build a new circumstance under which human beings actualize their declaration, an
artificial device is required as a guarantee to each other. What plays this crucial role is ‘sovereignty’.
And it is a society that a new circumstance with this notion would be. Society is constructed from
individuals along with covenants[promises] which humans transfer their rights with, or along with
declarations that they will never do anything involved in such rights towards the future. As a result of
this contract, human beings can be divided into two classes, sovereigns and subjects. Subjects are
those who are supposed to give up their rights, whereas sovereigns are those who are supposed not to
participate in such a waiver but to maintain their rights. Only sovereigns can keep their own liberty in
this new circumstance as they previously did in a natural state. For this reason, sovereigns can still be
threats to subjects, but not vice versa. With an hierarchy, a sovereign would supervise whether
subjects abide by their declaration, furthermore she has a power to punish them if they do not comply.
Her punishment is effective for subjects to be scary and terrifying as tantamount to an enemy’s attack
in the natural state. At least, it is guaranteed for them that other subjects will keep their declaration to
avoid the punishment thus they won't hurt them. Since all of them equally suffer from such a fear of
punishment.</p>
<h5><a href="#i2.2" name="p2.2">2.2. The circularity of sovereignty</a></h5>
<p>Subjects promise to set up sovereignty. The sovereignty can be maintained as long as this promise
is kept, otherwise it would be invalidated. The subjects endeavor to keep their promises for a reason
that punishments from a sovereign are recognized as fearful and universal apparatus. The fact that a
sovereign has sovereignty makes the punishments substantive. In this respect, sovereignty is based on
the promise, while fulfilling the promise is conversely based on sovereignty. Then a bizarre situation
comes up: sovereignty is a circular concept and society is just a word that expresses a circumstance in
which this circularity is adopted and vitalized.</p>
<p>Along with this context, on the one hand, for subjects, their society is causa sui, so there is no
reason to accept it or to refute it. However, the society still has its utility for the subjects because they
can minimize their mutual threats from themselves through adopting society. On the other hand, since
what makes a society activated is subjects' fear against the sovereign, the sovereign has an odd
privilege to justify everything which terrifies the subjects. The stronger and more sturdy her given
privilege gets, the bigger and heavier a burden which subjects have to carry comes up. Moreover,
there is no special reason that the sovereign cannot be impeached for, because what her a sovereign
depends on her sovereignty accepted as an useful axiom. There is no basis for defending the sovereign
against the impeachment, furthermore there is no mediation between the subjects and the sovereign.
Therefore, these two classes will inevitably be placed under the confrontation.</p>
<h5><a href="#i2.3" name="p2.3">2.3. An order and promise</a></h5>
<p>Foucault depicts the history of surveillance and punishment with his perspective of power<a href="#fn[13]" name="go[13]">[13]</a>. As
delineates it, what is important for him is a political effect that can be acquired by implementing such
institutions. Straightforwardly, this coincides with the circular sovereignty. A society can keep going
on with its subjects’ fear against a sovereign, so basically she longs for an opportunity to produce their
fear. This is the reason why corporal punishments are designed. Those refer to a virtual confrontation
in which the sovereign triumphs over a criminal who is already considered as an enemy against her
society. The mass fear is built by proving and demonstrating the force of the sovereign through the
processes of the corporal punishment. Thus, it is a naive understanding that the purpose of the
corporal punishment is merely to give the criminal a corresponding penalty for a violation of the
contract. On the contrary, the corporal punishment itself is the key of sustaining the society; it
maintains the sovereignty.</p>
<p>However, corporal punishments are not always successfully given. Failure of them is critical for
the sovereign since it is a sort of duel between the sovereign and a criminal who is regarded as the
sovereign’s virtual enemy. The criminal is stipulated to have virtual rights to defend herself and attack
the sovereign from the virtual form of duel, thus the criminal can sometimes abuse processes of
execution as her own opportunity to protest. For example, one of several steps of a corporal
punishment is a criminal’s public confession. What is intended with it is revealing the criminal’s
wretchedness and the sovereign’s magnificientness. However, the criminal rarely abuses this step as a
stage of a condemnation to the sovereign. As the criminal does so, she makes herself glorified and
denounces the sovereign, which has evident effects on subjects. They come to figure out that the
sovereign could fail, and their fear becomes less. Since a society is maintained by fear for the
sovereign, the fall of prestige is not just a matter of her dignity. If she is not necessarily able to beat
criminals from duels, a new strategy should be devised to maintain society.</p>
<p>At this point, there would be a shift in the sovereign’s strategy from the external control to the
internal regulation, put differently, to the upbringing of animals that can promise from fearing subjects
to command an order to them. We should discuss what fearing strategy is, in advance to discuss the
shift in the strategy. What a success of commanding an order to subjects means that the sovereign
success to make the subjects fulfill the order. As aforementioned, human beings are on their temporal
horizon. It means that they are on their present which heads forward to their future which is conceived
of by them. They go forwards to their future through being on their present. If their being on their
present is successful, then they realize what they conceive of. In this sense, human beings' being on
their present is behavior to their goal. Fulfilling an order is a kind of behavior. Thus, success in
fulfilling an order also realize a goal. However, this goal isn't conceived by the subject herself, but the
sovereign. The subject also knows it. If she doesn't know what an order exactly heads for, she cannot
successfully fulfill it. Then, when what an order conceives of is different from what the subjects
conceives of, she would not choose the former, but the latter. In order to prevent it and to force choose
the former, a sovereign uses fear. It conversely means that there is no reason for the subjects to fulfill
the sovereign's order were it not for fear. Corporal punishments are meant to make the fear for orders
but it contingently fails to produce it. In other words, it is revealed that fearing strategy has a weak
point; accidental failure. It is a necessity for sovereign to shift their strategy.</p>
<p>What the new strategy aims is simple: to remove the gap between what the sovereign conceives of
and what each subject conceives of. A method which the sovereign should take is also simple: to
make the subject conceive of what a sovereign conceive of, Put differently, to make them promise the
order.</p>
<p>This new strategy is executed as reformation. The reformation aims to make human beings who
their society does not demand as a member be disciplined as a type of person who the society does. Of
course, you can say that corporal punishments ultimately aim for it too. However, there is a critical
difference between these two ways. On the one hand, when a sovereign uses corporal punishments,
there must be a person who externally controls the subjects not to violate rules which the type of
person must obey. As we saw, this kind of external control necessarily results in a confrontation. On
the other hand, when a sovereign chooses to use the reformation, the person who controls them is the
each subject herself. To be more specific, what she exactly does in that case is to regulate herself to
meet the standard of life which society suggests. In order to make subjects control themselves, society
must make each subject be able to supervise herself and autonomous. To this end, the standards of life
are minutely quantified in order to be educated. For its violation, corporal pain of the previous type of
punishment is now replaced by a bad assessment within the system. Bad assessment makes subjects
try to adjust their own lives to the quantified standards of life in order to avoid it, which means that
subjects are likely to behave in the way society wants them to be. Since all these trials are achieved by
each of their individual efforts, the fear to force the order and the corporal punishments are naturally
discarded. This new type of strategy is the origin of the ability to promise. Thus, the formal ability to
exist as an individual involves an invention according to the needs of society. It is neither authentic
nor entirely independent from a society, unlike what Heidegger describes for Dasein, to be an
individual. Rather, society actively shows some specific examples of how they should exist as
individuals, though not always in a gentle way. Human beings come to coincide with such individuals
in the end.</p>
<p>However, there still remains questions: In what sense are such individuals be called individuals?
And is there any distinctive feature between individuals if all of them just decide to choose a socially
standardized life, thus the same form of life? How is it possible that they can recognize themselves as
distinct from others?</p>
<h4><a href="#i3" name="p3">3. Power and Value</a></h4>
<p>Although the existence of human beings takes precedence over society, it is true that individuals
are brought up by society. It is difficult for an individual to survive out of her society, for she makes
an adaptation of herself to live as a social person, not as an wild animal. Thus, being in her society is
essential for her survival. However, in terms of power, all individuals do not have an equal value on
their society. Strictly speaking, each human being can be replaced by others at any time and some
human beings are surplus for a society is not just a total sum of individuals in it. From this fact, a
society has power to impose specific identities on individuals. A society allocates its resources to the
types of human beings who it needs, while excluding those who it doesn't need from the inside of the
society. Therefore, trying to make herself a type of human being that the society demands is nearly the
only way she can survive in the society.</p>
<h5><a href="#i3.1" name="p3.1">3.1. Power and Life</a></h5>
<p>As described so far, it seems that the relation between society and individuals is entirely one-sided.
In order to discuss it, let us go back to the notion of ontological precedence of human beings over
society. In order to maintain a society, its members must be accompanied with it. It is absurd that a
society can control itself while it cannot control its members. Power has succeeded, both mentally and
physically, in having a restriction on what can be willed in society by targeting the minds of its
members. They could still choose by their will, while it now seems that only few options are left.
Society seems to have successfully controlled its members. However, there still remains what they
choose along with their will: the matter of whether they live or not. Now human beings live only in a
way society organizes. If so, in what sense are their lives meaningful for them? In a case in which an
individual could not tell herself ‘I want to live like in that way’ at any time, is there still any reason for
her to live?</p>
<p>According to Camus, suicide is a problem of judging whether life is or is not worth living amount<a href="#fn[14]" name="go[14]">[14]</a>.
More blatantly speaking, it is a profit-and-loss calculation of life. One's life is survival, and survival
is sustained with labor which is identical to fatigue. If fatigue is loss, it means that one's life is also
maintained through loss; the longer one's life lasts, the more the amount of one's losses accumulates.
One's life as survival and labor is not considered worthy to each individual and an individual should
leave her hands off in this situation, whereas a society cannot be maintained without individuals’
labor. At this point, society should give a suggestion on life to be worthwhile since a reasonable
person would not choose to live her life as survival and labor. Worthiness can be taken as a sort of
utility in that it is calculated to achieve one’s purpose and it is valid only in a point of view with a
specific purpose. Further consideration on power will explain how those kinds of views are made.</p>
<h5><a href="#i3.2" name="p3.2">3.2. Power and value expression</a></h5>
<p>Nietzsche mentioned the notion of will to power. I think that this can be interpreted as follows.
According to him, it is the nature of human beings to demand the meaning of their pain, which means
that they have a will to meaning. A source of every meaning of behaviors is power. It is a
phenomenon that occurs by an order of a sovereign over subjects. The sovereign commands subjects,
while the subject performs this. More to the point, what a subject actualize in this process is not her
will, but the sovereign's will. The subject implicitly takes the sovereign’s will as the meaning of what
she has done. For the subject's part, the sovereign's will to what subject have done becomes the
meaning of her labor. However, it is still questioned; what does the labor serve for? The subject
doesn't know what it is at all, but she couldn’t dare ask the sovereign. She just makes a guess that the
sovereign knows it, so this labor is postulated to have a purpose. As such, she borrows the meaning of
labor from the presence of the sovereign, thus it originates from not the subject, but the sovereign.
Indeed, will the sovereign think in a way the subject does? However whether her sovereign conceives
it or not is not seriously important for the subject because what she wants to make sure isn’t what the
meaning of her labor exactly is, but that her labor is worth it. Anyway, through power as the
phenomenon, the subject could stop asking whether her labor, that is, her pain, is worth or not. The
will to meaning of the subject results in her will to power. How is it going in the sovereign’s case?
Where does the sovereign draw the meaning of this? For the sovereign's part, there is no ground for it
other than herself since she has no other sovereign being in behalf of her. For this reason, Nietzsche
inevitably suggested that power is completed with the sovereign’s declaration like “But thus do I will
it! Thus shall I will it!”<a href="#fn[15]" name="go[15]">[15]</a> As for the completion of the power, in this context, the sovereign’s ground is
her being able to order, in other words, having a power to do so itself. Hence, as the sovereign, the
commander, the inventor, and a person in charge of the worthiness at the same time, she should make
such a value from being able to will. In other words, the will to meaning of the sovereign results in her
will to power. Therefore, in any case, it looks as a sort of leap that there is worthiness for a simple
reason that the power occurs.</p>
<p>One can think that Nietzsche also reveals the deficiency of ex nihilo nihil fit, like Heidegger's view
which we previously mentioned in chapter One. However, there is a reason that we don't have to think
in that way. In order to look into it, we should discuss how human beings become able to promise. To
promise, it is necessary to conceive of the future, but it is different from conceiving of actual being,
that is, ordinary objects such as an apple, a table, a cup, etc. In the case of actual beings, the reason
why we can conceive of this kind of actual beings is because those things inform us what they are
likely to be, to the effect that those lead us to conceiving. Thanks to their information offering, we can
conceive of those things. On the other hand, the way the future works is completely not like an actual
being, in that it cannot inform us what they are likely to be in real, even further it cannot lead us to
conceiving. Conceiving of the future just falls into the problem of ex nihilo nihil fit.</p>
<p>However such a problem arises when it is dealt only with in a personal context, which we already
see the theoretical deficiency that the notion of Heidegger’s boredom showed us. What the discussion
of Foucault and Hobbes shows us is that the gap could be filled up with help of a perspective from a
social dimension. Society invents individuals who are able to promise to maintain society. What
society did in order to invent it is only to offer detailed timetables to its members. Of course, what the
timetables they ought to obey refer to are not a purpose of their behaviors, but simply just their
behaviors. But each human being can also observe that others behave as the timetables command. As
doing so, they could reversely infer that something is expressed or is achieved with such behaviors,
from observation. They could make a supposition on an assumed value in this manner. This way of
inference is, of course, invalid, but it works.</p>
<p>Let us see how that way of inferring or reasoning works inside of each individual. Their
observation on others’ behavior is similar to appreciating a performance of pantomime. Suppose two
situations in which we can experience. In one situation, there is a prisoner imprisoned in a glass wall
and we are actually watching her, exterior to the wall. And in another situation, there is a pantomimer
on a stage who is mimicking a prisoner and expressing a fake glass wall around her and we are
enjoying her performance. In the first case, the glass wall that surrounds the prisoner has, of course, an
extension but it is not so visible that the prisoner could not pass through it. It is the perceivable
obstacle only through which the prisoner as well as we observers both come to realize that there is a
glass wall. On the other hand, in the second case, the aim of the pantomimer is just to make us believe
that she is stuck in a real glass wall. She pretends to be imprisoned in what does not exist. In order to
do so, she should understand and calculate the effects which the glass wall is likely to have on a
prisoner, and then behave as if there were such effects. Not only could the effects arise from the actual
being, but the virtual being could be also inferred from the masqueraded expression of the effects. The
worthiness or the value is virtual, in such a sense.</p>
<p>Therefore, one's worthiness or value could be given not just from the timetable itself, but from her
observation on that others are complying with the timetable. This kind of non-actual but assumed
value is invented by the observer, so it originally belongs to the observer herself. What matters in
promising is not the contents of the declaration, but the will to actualize it. To will them, one must
regard them as worthy or valuable. To regard something valuable, one must be able to conceive
something virtual but achievable. Because it is virtual, it couldn’t be given, so it should be invented by
each individual. Therefore an ability to create something virtual from nothing in a society is,
technically speaking, the basis of making promise.</p>
<h5><a href="#i3.3" name="p3.3">3.3. Man as a political animal</a></h5>
<p>Every standard of a life suggested by a society has the potentialities to be reinterpreted by every
individuals and to become their self-expression when each individual is able to design a view on
something masqueraded. Actualizing this possibility is power as a phenomenon, as what Nietzsche
intended above. Since there remain such possibilities, a standardized life from a society becomes into
a life of an individual, as an order from a society becomes into a promise of an individual. However,
such an invention itself concerns not social but just personal work, and what an individual tries to
express with it only refers to herself. Unless such a life is demanded by society, in the long run, how
could an individual survive?</p>
<p>All individuals are social animals in a sense that they live with the others. It is because mental
products do not apply directly to physical and extended environments. Fortunately, individuals can
communicate with each other. If an individual persuades others successfully, then her values could
become the value of a group as a dominant one and some of them may gradually become the value of
society as a super-dominant one, e.i. the power in real sense. This power can lead to a change in their
society, sometimes. Each individual must persuade the others around them if she wants to change
society. In doing this, individuals could bring their mental products into the world. I'd like to call this
way of process 'politics'.</p>
